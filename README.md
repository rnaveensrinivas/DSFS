# DSFS - Data Science From Scratch

This repository contains resources and code for building **Machine Learning models from first principles**. The goal is to understand the core concepts behind machine learning algorithms, without relying on high-level libraries, while implementing everything from scratch.

#### `READMEs/`
This directory contains detailed notes and explanations related to the implementation of ML models.

#### `scratch/`
The `scratch/` package contains the foundational code for implementing machine learning models from first principles. Each file within this package is dedicated to a specific aspect of machine learning, focusing on building algorithms and methods from the ground up, with no reliance on high-level libraries.

## Goals

The primary objectives of this repository are:
- To develop a deep understanding of machine learning algorithms from the ground up.
- To implement algorithms and methods starting from mathematical foundations (linear algebra, statistics, etc.) rather than relying on pre-built models or libraries.
- To encourage a more transparent and intuitive approach to machine learning by providing clear, well-documented code and explanations.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rnaveensrinivas/rnaveensrinivas-DSFS.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `scratch/` directory where the implementation of algorithms resides:
   ```bash
   cd rnaveensrinivas-DSFS/scratch/
   ```

3. Explore and modify the Python files to experiment with different algorithms or methods. Add new scripts or models to the `scratch/` directory as needed.

4. Check out the `READMEs/` directory for additional theoretical explanations and visualizations.
